## About Me_

Hi, nice to meet you. I'm a software & security engineer based in the Washington, D.C. area. I have experience & expertise in web service development, microservices, full-stack and mobile development, application security validation & tooling (e.g. SAST/DAST/SCA), IDM & IAM engineering and solutions, compliance (PCI/HIPAA/SOC-2), web application penetration testing, security architecture, cloud security (AWS), and various other security technologies.

Most recently (before my current career gap), I was a Staff Product Security Engineer and Team Lead at Toast, where I was the first product security hire and, while building a team of security & software engineers, launched numerous security initiatives including developer training, penetration testing, bug bounty, security automation, threat modeling, and security standards. 

## Core specialization_

I am highly experienced in web application security and security architecture, with a focus on cloud environments and developer collaboration, primarily in high-level programming languages.

## Other focuses_

Other things I have worked on include full stack development, identity engineering, mobile development, cloud security, cryptography, and team/organizational leadership.

## Working on_

I'm not yet an expert in hardware security, operating and/or embedded systems security, or low-level programming languages, but I'd love to learn more about them.

## I'm excited to_

I'd be excited to help any organization build and deploy improvements to their security through innovative security tools, process automation, and developer empowerment. Opportunities to read, write, and talk code are a big plus. 

## But not so excited to_

While I have relevant skills and can share expertise as needed, I'm not currently looking for roles that include significant work in vulnerability management, incident management/response, or other operations analyst-style work. I'm also not currently looking for founding leadership roles.


## Career Timeline_

### Career Break

From August 2022, I have been a taking a break from full-time employment after 5+ very long years at Toast to travel, accomplish personal goals, develop new skills, and spend time with friends and family. I look forward to sharing my accomplishments during this time with friends, colleagues, and whomever else cares to listen to me ramble. 

A small sample of the things I've spent time on during this period include:

- » Two months of travel around the world
- » Improving skills in electrical and hardware engineering (e.g. CAD/EDA tools/Circuit design/Microcontrollers) and reverse analysis using digital logic analyzers and similar tools
- » Building a fully virtualized (PVE) "homelab" environment including clustering, enterprise-grade logging (Graylog), high-availability, remote development, and container management, with a focus on automation and distributed systems, as well as honeypots and other security research tools.
- » Pursuing other hobbies such as history, foreign languages, and photography

### Toast

At Toast, I was responsible for building out a product security program from scratch starting in 2018. During this time, I built and led a small team of security & software engineers to support a number of security efforts, including product penetration testing, engineering compliance, secure coding training, vulnerability management, as well as platform security design, review, & development. Along with my team, I developed and launched secure coding training, bug bounty, threat modeling, and security champions programs. I also developed a set of security and cryptography standards, as well as some standardized security tooling. I also became a subject matter expert in the PCI DSS to assist the company in completing its required annual PCI DSS Level 1 Service Provider audits. In 2022, I was awarded the Toast Founder's Award for my work in this role.
